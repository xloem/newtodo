01 0817 ET: "I like logging. Logging is easy. I want to work on software to log."
		journal: the expression of just the thought helps one engage internal inhibitions without threatening them much
		         it also seems possible the big focuses and intentions are building further inhibitions.
		                    we want some kind of plan. how much etc.
			0852 we thought briefly of scheduling a logging support ritual. it seemed like it would be helpful
