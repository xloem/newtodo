01 0817 ET: "I like logging. Logging is easy. I want to work on software to log."
		journal: the expression of just the thought helps one engage internal inhibitions without threatening them much
		         it also seems possible the big focuses and intentions are building further inhibitions.
		                    we want some kind of plan. how much etc.
			0852 we thought briefly of scheduling a logging support ritual. it seemed like it would be helpful
				0927 i'm thinking of how it might be easy to increase logging slowly using the returning
				     let's try it. we'll start with just 1 second and keep increasing. after every
				     returning. [increasing by a single second]
0929	1 second
			first task would be to just make or engage a timer that does seconds.
1009	2 seconds
			journal: i'm having more trouble converging my eyes than usual
			         i'd like to hang at 2 seconds for now. i'm interested in developing the repeating phrases or such.
				i think one of the concerns is how much time it takes up waiting for slow devices
				and sorting out timers. it's nicer if there's a clearer path to including time for more
				behaviors later. it coudl be a different timer-associated inhibition, not certain.
						sounds like a more responsive timer would be nicer.
				yeah not one that turns it's screen off and then pauses a long time, or is hard
				to get to if fingers are spasming
				i also want to think about other things, but here there's a lot of planning
				ther next device setup
						so maybe an automatic script would help here. relates with
						a different concern, but would help work with the reasons.
								not sure
