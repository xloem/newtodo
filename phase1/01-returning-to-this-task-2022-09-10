"newtodo is good. i can work on newtodo regularly."

0815 internally once
0815 began repeating
0815 update:
	"newtodo is good. i can work on newtodo regularly. i want to work on newtodo regularly."
once out loud.
0816 stopped with concerns.

"i'll wait 5 minutes, and then return to todo and say this."

0820
	"i'll wait 5 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."
		journal: blargh i need a clock! ok maybe this phone can work ... hmm it's out of space .. lost another phone ... ummm ....
			there's an ipad i can use.
			system issues
0825
	"i'll wait 30 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."

		journal: back. waiting for timer to hit 30.

02 0858 ET: "I'll wait 30 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."

		journal: I guess I'll try to be able to return for at least 2 days, before adding tasks. Makes sense to lengthen time I think.
		         i'm back with 20 seconds to spare. i'm thinking i'll up to an hour to reduce pressure.
			 i'm also thinking of trying different tasks.

03 0930 ET: "I'll wait 60 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."
		journal: it's 10:21, 9 minutes left. i'm back cause the ipad ran out of battery.
			 i was doing logistic but i'm trying to be diverse to support the behavior some,
			 so i may do a recreation thing in the next hour
				or maybe not! who kjnows! am in ther middle of faxing some stuff which apparently
				isn't necessary, and also considering signing it
				the big goal is _making food_. we were shivering in shower despite not too cold.
				so, more food has value.
				maybe recreation then food, dunno. feeling more hungry now! maybe food first!
				1030. i started playing a chess game. i like how the deadline encourages leaving
				the game despite in-game consequences.
04 1031 ET: "I'll wait until 11:30, and then return to newtoodo and say this."
		journal: when sitting here, we like the idea of eating. the shower part is harder. we're encouraging
		         cold showering / showering by associating with eating.
				i can feel part of karl's intense experiences associated with these tasks
				they kind of separate the different goals, ideas, and behaviors, really strongly
			 we're having some negative feedback after mentioning it to father .. also a little prior
			 what might make it both more reliable and more gentle, is something some are wondering
					well we mentioned recreation, but maybe dropping back to half an hour would make
					it simpler.
			 yeah great idea thanks
				thinking some on doing activities associated with newtodo
				the plan was to make sure we returned for a couple days
				we'd then want to make sure we spend time on activities we value, outside it.
			1131. a little late.
05 1131 ET: "I'll wait until 12:01, and then return to newtodo and say this."
		journal: 1159 . we're thinking that a chant in the mind between the task could help reinforce it
		                or out loud, either one.
				thinking like ... "I like visiting newtodo regularly, and i want to plan what else I want to do."
				maybe? unsure.
06 1201 ET: "I'll wait until 12:31, and then return to newtodo and say this."
07 1231 ET: "I'll do things until 1:01, and then return to newtodo and say this."
08 1301 ET: "I'll do things until 1:31, and then return to this document and say this again."
		journal: I added the "this document" part because "newtodo" sounds like the town my dad is at.
		         I'm having a psychotic itch, so may do more recreation.
					we want to keep this task gentle and not stimulate the psychoticish issues
					maybe it's time to lengthen to an hour or longer
					or to severely reduce the amount of interaction
					or to really associate with recreation
					reminder: we're making food, we have 6 minutes
			my itch went away wairs. 1:34, 3 minutes late
09 1334 ET: "I'll do things until 2:04, and then return to this document and say this again."
		journal: we want to work on the log task, so as to value this pattern with productivity reasons
		         got a psychotic 'spark' pressure, so gonna do something else for a bit
			 to protect the returning pattern until it establishes
				remembering: 2:04, 1404.
			1400. i'm back. waiting for 4 minutes.
			wow i wanted to start a side task ... and somehow actually started it
			interesting schism between journaling it near it, and journaling it here. much easier here.
			1403.
					it doesn't look like the log thing is actually doing anything as far as i see
			1404.
10 1404 ET: "I'll do things until 2:34, and then return to this document and say this again."
		journal: when associated with mind control i'm enjoying the repetition.
		         when i use willpower for repetition, it works poorly for me. very poorly.
			 i guess there's a difference between making it happen, and starting with just a phrase.
		         but i was looking forward to 14:34.
			 it's 1434
11 1434 ET: "I'll do things until 1504, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: remembering i have some papers to sign
12 1504 ET: "I'll do things until 1535, and then return to this document and think this again."
		it's 16:01 . i missed 1535 somehow.
		we're also struggling internally, some wanting it to be longer apart
		maybe i'll return tomorrow, not sure.
13 1602 ET: "I'll do things until 1802 or until i wake if i sleep, and then return to this document and think this again."
		"If I get stuck, I'll plan to use repetetition to try to get myself to return."
		journal: we thank you for the extra space. we do want to do the thing some. sorry about the pressure.
		         we like having a pattern that helps us do things more.
			we might come back before ... 1802 ... we'll see. !
14 1634 ET: "I'll do things until 1804 or until i wake if i sleep, and then return to this document and think this again."
15 1707 ET: "I'll do things until 1807 or until i wake if i sleep, and then return to this document and think this again."
16 1731 ET: "I'll do things until 1801 or until i wake if i sleep, and then return to this document and think this again."
17 1803 ET: "I'll do things until 1833, and then return to this document and think this again."
18 1831 ET: "I'll do things until 1901, and then return to this document and think this again."
19 1906 ET: "I'll do things until 1936, and then return to this document and think this again."
20 1930 ET: "I'll do things until 2000, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: with the exhaustion, which have experienced a lot of over years for tasks that would
		         otherwise be quite simple, maybe finding a way to make it gentler could help.
		         something that more pleasance can resonate with, maybe.
		         alternatively, pushing through is what usually try.
					i think the hour-minutes could be hard. may be wrong.
21 2001 ET: "I'll do things until 2031, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: i'm thinking maybe it would make sense to slowly increase the length of these if i want them
		         farther apart. 30 minutes, 31 minutes, 32 minutes ...
		         it's 20:30. i'm waiting for 20:31 or 20:32.
22 2031 ET: "I'll sleep until I get up, and then return to this document and think this again."
			"It's good to get up when you wake up. I can get up when I wake up. I like getting up when
			 I wake up!"

2022-09-11 01:34
23 0135 ET: "I'll do things until 2:06, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: I'm taking time to just kind of sing to myself comfortingly.
			 And: "I'm doing things until 2:06, and then I'm returning to this document and thinking this again."
		         I'm trying to develop a feeling of love, and thinking of how all the signs point to doing this.

		         I'm telling a caring story of something I deeply value.
			And: "I'm doing things until 0206, and then I'm returning to this document and thinking this again. I have just twelve minutes left."
24 0206 ET: "I'll do things until 2:38, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: "I'm doing things until 0238, and then I'm returning to this document and thinking this again."
	 	         "It's good to return to this document regularly. I really like returning regularly."
		         "I'm doing things until 0238, and then I'm returning to this document and thinking this again."
			 "It's good to return to this document regularly. I really like returning regularly."
25 0238 ET: "I'll do things until 0310, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: I typed the wrong return time by accident. Involving arithmetic in the phrase seems a little
		         stumbly. I like the idea of having me think some, but less so it being math.
			      We're thinking we might keep it. Some of us neuron workers can figure the arithmetic out.
			      More [thinking/intelligent feedback] involved means more consciousness.
			"I worry, imagining things going wrong. But I know things can go far better than I imagine.
			 I know I can do things that I often see as impossible. I know I can."
				I had mysterious luck playing video games to support this over past day.
				I would like to do much more than that, and it's what the process is all about.
				I think the luck was personal skill stemming from fewer internal distractions.
				Today, I do want to play fewer video games, but returning to this document regularly
			        is what's important to me.
			        I'm imagining getting all my disorganized files organized, from this document.
				I'm imagining my tensions and weird experiences slowly fading away.
			        I'm imagining finding things easy again.
		         It would be helpful for us if we had an inbetween ritual for times that seem hard.
			 I infer we were thinking of having a task. Maybe a not-too-charged task we'll do very much.
			 Maybe every other returning?
		         The consistency, the sameness, really helps.
			        I like the idea. I forgot I was working on some things already.
				I'm thinking this repository makes some sense for working on.
			        I infer we'd back it with a chant or thought or ritual.
			 We should check the notes document. For patterns for doing with reasons.
			 I think organizing our spaces would really help everything else be easier. This would
			 support other things too. I also see value to working on this. But I propose organizing spaces
			 so we develop task diversity, and do things that build supports for this, even though it's a little harder.
		         I also like umm daily routines like toothbrushing etc. Getting good at normal life will help
		         others support our coping approach.
		         If organizing is very difficult, maybe it's not the thing. Whatever's good.
		                 I think we can do it. Slowly, gently.
26 0310 ET: "I'll do things until 0343, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: A task that wasn't working yesterday is working today.
		         A kind spirit shared that mind control is unnatural.
		         The parts are not for controlling; they are for dancing in ritual, communicating, trusting, celebrating, changing a culture in harmony together when the environment changes, handling the importance of severe grief, so many things.
		         This is good to learn, and I understand I have more to learn.
				And we want to check that, and see how much likelihood it has.
			 		When the heart is together, such concepts are backed realizations, not mysteries.
			It's 0344 and i'm calculating the next time. I'll add 33.
27 0344 ET: "I'll do things until 0417, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: (04:00) some of our parts were thinking we'd move towards on-the-hour for scheduling
		         it's 0414 and i'm waiting for 0417. guess i'd better calculate the next time.
			 the on hour stuff does make some sense. on the fence unfortunately.
			 maybe since it's still only the second day, the on hour might make sense.
			 we might want to try the challenge of changing minutes though.
28 0417 ET: "I'll do things until 0451, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: "I'll do things until 0451, and then return to this document and think this again."
		         the delay at the moment is 34 minutes.
		         it's 0449. i could do 0525 next for 35 minutes, or go back to sleep to get up again.
			 might try sleep, unsure. well, i'll stay up to reinforce this more. resuming was hard.
29 0451 ET: "I'll do things until 0525, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: i tried playing a video game to encourage the staying up late. it's 0508 and i was
		         invited to play another and accepted. they last 20 minutes or so. i'm a little worried.
		         but basically, i'll be prioritising this over that. hopefully!
			0522. 0524, closed it incomplete.
30 0525 ET: "I'll do things until 0559, and then return to this document and think this again."
31 0604 ET: "I'll do things until 0639, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: i went to another environment and that was different. i thought of how so many of
		         my thoughts happen from changing how i do things and environments, nowadays.
		         some worry. regardless, i'd like to nap i think, after waking up so early.
		         thinking giving the ease of the nap helps with positivity associated.
		         	one of the reasons for the nap is to include these other thoughts, from different
				environment. we'll try it.
					31 0615 ET: "I want to make sure I'm welcomed well here. I'll sleep until I get up, and then return to this document and think this again."
				i'm afraid we disagree. i dont' want to squelch other cognitive parts,
				but i also don't want to establish behaviors that could confuse this.
				we're planning to nap in the other environment at 0639.
					we agree
32 0639 ET: "I'll sleep until I get up, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: 0639. worried about the disonnance in the last one. hoping things stay :)
			  we were at 35 minutes.
			0659 i got up easier than i have in years
33 0659 ET: "I'll do things until 0736, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: 0734. figuring next time. my phone said 0739. somewhat confusing.
34 0735 ET: "I'll do things until 0814, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: I'm guessing I miss-saw a 4 as a 9.
		         0813.
35 0814 ET: "I'll do things until 0851, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: I was staring right at the time and didn't realize it was 0814.
		         0851 from 0814 is maybe 37. 38 from 0851 is 0929.
36 0851 ET: "I'll do things until 0929, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: 0929, then 1007 or 1008
37 0929 ET: "I'll do things until 1008, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: next time would be ... 1048 . i'm thinking of plateauing at 45 minutes until tomorrow
		         1008. maybe i'll start looking for a timer.
			 i'm feeling more hungry as i engage the timer. reminds me of the showering thing, maybe.
			 my experiences started _really_ spreading across contexts around 2014 when things changed.
38 1008 ET: "I'll do things until 1048, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: seems I just came to this at 1008 by chance a bit, would have liked to have been slightly earlier
		         this one is until 1048. after that might be 1129.
39 1053 ET: "I'll do things until 1153, and then return to this document and think this again."
40 1230 ET: "I'll do things until 1314, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: the usb of this pi seems busted, a reboot likely would work around, could be heavy load doesn't look like it
		         1258 please do not play the video game. there is likely/possibly a path where this reduces the swelliness.
		              the behavior is impressive. however, its pattern could be improved.
			      	  some of us did not realise the intensity. there may be a degree of warrantedness to the video game
			      it sounds like you need help finding paths through it
			          karl can we engage the returning with more gentle-considering to make it less swelly?
		                  maybe focus on less, but still do
			    imo the swelliness is because the wrong path is happening [the glimpse of the path part was brief unfortunately]
			"i like visiting this document regularly. it's nice. i want to visit it regularly. i want to make it more!"
			"new-todo document, new-todo document, new-todo document, new-todo documents !"
			"want to work on new-todo." "want to work on new-todo!"
41 1315 ET: "I'll sleep or do things until some time has passed, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: we want to do work, not being-mindless.
		         we're about to fix the bug in [gitlakepy] where arkb fills the tmp folder so full the system hangs on reboot
		         it's 1402
42 1402 ET: "I'll do things, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: we removed underlining from _do things_. :) be well !
43 1425 ET: "I'll do things or not until I return, and then return to this document and think this again."
44 1447 ET: "I'll do things or not until I return, hoping to maybe set a time, and then return to this document and think this again."
45 1607 ET: "I'll do things or not until 1647, and then return to this document and think this again."
46 1649 ET: "I'll do things or not until 1740, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: it sounds like we could use a strong action that assigns repeated phrases and initiates repeating them.
					we may be doing the 2 days waiting to see if it works. there's been some stuttering.
					dissonance around that may be related to the lack of assigning new things.
					it's true though we so far have returned to the document
					the pattern has changed
					looking at top of file, looks like we originally meant to work on the repository. not just return.
					--
				1727 and i visited
				1737 we came back because karl was planning to give up a little
				     there is some acknowledgement around value of just building the habit of returning.
				     maybe with observing and noting that there are avenues where other things can happen _easily_
				    ... maybe not with difficulty.
				we can validate doing an hour between in that earlier there was an attempt to do an hour between.
				and when doing this, one sees how some patterns can retain shorter times better
				[possibly by retaining attention on the concept]
47 1740 ET: "I'll do things until 1830, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: i'm worried about continuing. changing the phrase seems to make it harder, but also 
					-- let's go back to the _first_ phrase
47 1741 ET: "I'll wait 5 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."
		journal: starting with precise start again works again.
		         idea: repetition of something that has good feelings around it for using.
			the other issue was the buildup of 'swelliness', 'pressure' around the task
			this seems a smidge similar to differing of the pattern because under the hood there is some idea
			 that 'swelliness' might relate to cognitive parts actively acting on different assumptions
			i have an inhibition again.
						_if this is valuable_, we want to stand firm.
						we're likely going to plan to do that.
47 1746 ET: "I'll wait 39 minutes and then return to newtodo and say this."
		journal: it is 1754 and i am without task
				"i have downtime and need a task, i believe"
				"i want to do a task i have ongoing"
				"it's good to do an ongoing task"
				"it's good to do a planned task. i want to do a planned task. i like doing planned tasks."
				"i want to work on a planned task or part."
			 we're kind of lost.
			:) found a state of mind to do a pleasant puzzle. it goes on a little too long. unsure how to engage.
			so relaxing compared to other things.
			it's 1817. earlier taking a nap seemed pretty important. but now it seems like the thing to do is
			to just type a thing again and do what it says, a thing just the same as before.
			i don't want to stimulate the issues causing the nap urge without providing the nap
48 1817 ET: "I'll nap until I get up, and then return to newtodo and say this."

		journal:  [waking up we had the big slam slam that has some memory around being squished torture and traum aexperiences or something, and maybe auditory white noise components. it was [entrained? [it could resonate with my behaviors at an early point in their influence i think maybe, a different part near the decision making maybe]] with inhibition [on a deeper area], making it much harder to get up using existing approaches. excited to have done so.]

			journal: some inhibition splash vs the tasks. noting this aligns with spending time after them not doing
			         them. when i spent the whole hour doing the task, i didn't have a sense of inhibition splash much.
					neuron journal: we think that the "inhibition" may stem from times spent not doing, feeling,
					                or thinking the things. that it may grow from these times.
							there may be a topical mistake in the neuron journal, uncertain.

			another tbehavior return concept we have is [hard to imemdiately type?]
			brain science has really advanced. hoem brain science could yield return. i guess it might not be immediately behavioral ... home neurofeedback? [since eeg models are so strongish, we can likely identify causes of serious behavioral problems or skills, and just use our consciousness to encourage discourage them by seeing more parts. this is likely much easier via eeg than video.] [we believe home neurofeedback using modernish ai yields strong behavioral return. -neuron group]

		journal: i'm not sure AI belongs in the list. but i guess it's just a prototype list.
			 i might squeeze it into the software dev ctaegory. keep as is now though i suppose.
					many of us interpret _stopping_ making an AI in 2013 or such as mind control
					that could put it back in the list for a while, but it would change how it is
					also technology has changed. many things can be more automated now.
			[neuron relation happened]
			i/we've been working on pilgrimaging the getting out of bed.
			right now lots of standing up expressions, karl likes
			he says the reason i love standing up is because it represents activityness[-or-such] for me,
			and it has been so very long
				[suspect question around loving standing up shows issue in mind, doesn't seem something
				 that would be questioned. maybe a misunderstanding of love as meaning romance.]
			during writing, eeg app had frozen. seems i've likely exhausted space or something

		journal: theory around mind control and meditation and focus:
			neurons wire to focus areas over time [for attempt at relevence maybe]
			then if the focus area is changeable, which most are in some way, mind control can develop
			via moving what all those overfocused wirings engage to relate to other things
			we're just saying things internally, without sustained focus, so it leaves a lot open
			this also opens a bit of a theoryish around the current situation and all the intensity --
			could be big groups of overfocused neurons
				the nice thing about this new expression is that it includes a way to change things
				it's confusing to be aware of your own strong patterns
				but in general, when we engage something, we can use it to change the pattern [lcd broke]
				[such. lcd break was very brief.] it's 0529

		journal: [we wrote a dream because it was part of thinking and planning, but are removing due to
			  past experience with writing dreams online]
			 basically i'm thinking about the inside of encouraging via repetition, and mind control, i guess,
			 wondering how to encourage relevent behavior in situations like this, from a small perspective
					it's likely nice to do things we want to do rather than other urges
					the dream likely encouraged doing this
