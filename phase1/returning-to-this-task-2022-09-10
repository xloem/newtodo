"newtodo is good. i can work on newtodo regularly."

0815 internally once
0815 began repeating
0815 update:
	"newtodo is good. i can work on newtodo regularly. i want to work on newtodo regularly."
once out loud.
0816 stopped with concerns.

"i'll wait 5 minutes, and then return to todo and say this."

0820
	"i'll wait 5 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."
		journal: blargh i need a clock! ok maybe this phone can work ... hmm it's out of space .. lost another phone ... ummm ....
			there's an ipad i can use.
			system issues
0825
	"i'll wait 30 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."

		journal: back. waiting for timer to hit 30.

02 0858 ET: "I'll wait 30 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."

		journal: I guess I'll try to be able to return for at least 2 days, before adding tasks. Makes sense to lengthen time I think.
		         i'm back with 20 seconds to spare. i'm thinking i'll up to an hour to reduce pressure.
			 i'm also thinking of trying different tasks.

03 0930 ET: "I'll wait 60 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."
		journal: it's 10:21, 9 minutes left. i'm back cause the ipad ran out of battery.
			 i was doing logistic but i'm trying to be diverse to support the behavior some,
			 so i may do a recreation thing in the next hour
				or maybe not! who kjnows! am in ther middle of faxing some stuff which apparently
				isn't necessary, and also considering signing it
				the big goal is _making food_. we were shivering in shower despite not too cold.
				so, more food has value.
				maybe recreation then food, dunno. feeling more hungry now! maybe food first!
				1030. i started playing a chess game. i like how the deadline encourages leaving
				the game despite in-game consequences.
04 1031 ET: "I'll wait until 11:30, and then return to newtoodo and say this."
		journal: when sitting here, we like the idea of eating. the shower part is harder. we're encouraging
		         cold showering / showering by associating with eating.
				i can feel part of karl's intense experiences associated with these tasks
				they kind of separate the different goals, ideas, and behaviors, really strongly
			 we're having some negative feedback after mentioning it to father .. also a little prior
			 what might make it both more reliable and more gentle, is something some are wondering
					well we mentioned recreation, but maybe dropping back to half an hour would make
					it simpler.
			 yeah great idea thanks
				thinking some on doing activities associated with newtodo
				the plan was to make sure we returned for a couple days
				we'd then want to make sure we spend time on activities we value, outside it.
			1131. a little late.
05 1131 ET: "I'll wait until 12:01, and then return to newtodo and say this."
		journal: 1159 . we're thinking that a chant in the mind between the task could help reinforce it
		                or out loud, either one.
				thinking like ... "I like visiting newtodo regularly, and i want to plan what else I want to do."
				maybe? unsure.
06 1201 ET: "I'll wait until 12:31, and then return to newtodo and say this."
07 1231 ET: "I'll do things until 1:01, and then return to newtodo and say this."
08 1301 ET: "I'll do things until 1:31, and then return to this document and say this again."
		journal: I added the "this document" part because "newtodo" sounds like the town my dad is at.
		         I'm having a psychotic itch, so may do more recreation.
					we want to keep this task gentle and not stimulate the psychoticish issues
					maybe it's time to lengthen to an hour or longer
					or to severely reduce the amount of interaction
					or to really associate with recreation
					reminder: we're making food, we have 6 minutes
			my itch went away wairs. 1:34, 3 minutes late
09 1334 ET: "I'll do things until 2:04, and then return to this document and say this again."
		journal: we want to work on the log task, so as to value this pattern with productivity reasons
		         got a psychotic 'spark' pressure, so gonna do something else for a bit
			 to protect the returning pattern until it establishes
				remembering: 2:04, 1404.
			1400. i'm back. waiting for 4 minutes.
			wow i wanted to start a side task ... and somehow actually started it
			interesting schism between journaling it near it, and journaling it here. much easier here.
			1403.
					it doesn't look like the log thing is actually doing anything as far as i see
			1404.
10 1404 ET: "I'll do things until 2:34, and then return to this document and say this again."
		journal: when associated with mind control i'm enjoying the repetition.
		         when i use willpower for repetition, it works poorly for me. very poorly.
			 i guess there's a difference between making it happen, and starting with just a phrase.
		         but i was looking forward to 14:34.
			 it's 1434
11 1434 ET: "I'll do things until 1504, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: remembering i have some papers to sign
12 1504 ET: "I'll do things until 1535, and then return to this document and think this again."
		it's 16:01 . i missed 1535 somehow.
		we're also struggling internally, some wanting it to be longer apart
		maybe i'll return tomorrow, not sure.
13 1602 ET: "I'll do things until 1802 or until i wake if i sleep, and then return to this document and think this again."
		"If I get stuck, I'll plan to use repetetition to try to get myself to return."
		journal: we thank you for the extra space. we do want to do the thing some. sorry about the pressure.
		         we like having a pattern that helps us do things more.
			we might come back before ... 1802 ... we'll see. !
14 1634 ET: "I'll do things until 1804 or until i wake if i sleep, and then return to this document and think this again."
15 1707 ET: "I'll do things until 1807 or until i wake if i sleep, and then return to this document and think this again."
16 1731 ET: "I'll do things until 1801 or until i wake if i sleep, and then return to this document and think this again."
17 1803 ET: "I'll do things until 1833, and then return to this document and think this again."
18 1831 ET: "I'll do things until 1901, and then return to this document and think this again."
19 1906 ET: "I'll do things until 1936, and then return to this document and think this again."
20 1930 ET: "I'll do things until 2000, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: with the exhaustion, which have experienced a lot of over years for tasks that would
		         otherwise be quite simple, maybe finding a way to make it gentler could help.
		         something that more pleasance can resonate with, maybe.
		         alternatively, pushing through is what usually try.
					i think the hour-minutes could be hard. may be wrong.
21 2001 ET: "I'll do things until 2031, and then return to this document and think this again."
		journal: i'm thinking maybe it would make sense to slowly increase the length of these if i want them
		         farther apart. 30 minutes, 31 minutes, 32 minutes ...
		         it's 20:30. i'm waiting for 20:31 or 20:32.
22 2031 ET: "I'll sleep until I get up, and then return to this document and think this again."
			"It's good to get up when you wake up. I can get up when I wake up. I like getting up when
			 I wake up!"

23 0135 ET: "I'll do things until 2:05, and then return to this document and think this again."
