	"i'll wait 30 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."

		journal: back. waiting for timer to hit 30.

02 0858 ET: "I'll wait 30 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."

		journal: I guess I'll try to be able to return for at least 2 days, before adding tasks. Makes sense to lengthen time I think.
		         i'm back with 20 seconds to spare. i'm thinking i'll up to an hour to reduce pressure.
			 i'm also thinking of trying different tasks.

03 0930 ET: "I'll wait 60 minutes, and then return to newtodo and say this."
		journal: it's 10:21, 9 minutes left. i'm back cause the ipad ran out of battery.
			 i was doing logistic but i'm trying to be diverse to support the behavior some,
			 so i may do a recreation thing in the next hour
				or maybe not! who kjnows! am in ther middle of faxing some stuff which apparently
				isn't necessary, and also considering signing it
				the big goal is _making food_. we were shivering in shower despite not too cold.
				so, more food has value.
				maybe recreation then food, dunno. feeling more hungry now! maybe food first!
				1030. i started playing a chess game. i like how the deadline encourages leaving
				the game despite in-game consequences.
