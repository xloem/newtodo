I'm logging my attempts to de-/re- program my behaviors towards ones I prefer. I was inspired by starting to read a book on mind control.

This is the latest of many broken todo lists and behavior influencing attempts for myself. As usual, I would like to integrate all the old ones into this, if it works. 

# The Plan

## Phase 1: Does it work?

1. Select an approach such as chanting that can sometimes get a hard task to initiate quickly and continue.
2. The approach will be used carefully and slowly, and each use will be logged in this repository.
3. The frequency of use will be steadily increased, on a schedule that is specific to task categories.
   That is, if a category of tasks is harder, the approach will be used less frequently, at first.

The intent is to use the logging to sort categories and plan around what works and what doesn't.
The expectation is that, given my experience struggling and strengthening, this
approach can be made to succeed for general tasks.

## Phase 2: Be conscious and rational

Once it is demonstrated the approach can continue working consistently while being logged, I'll want to
focus on behaviors that engage important things like executive functioning, major goals, rational choices, etc.

An idea is to support these both by encouraging their larger goal, and by encouraging the parts needed to reach them.
