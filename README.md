I'm logging my attempts to de-/re- program my behaviors towards ones I prefer. I was inspired by starting to read a book on mind control.

This is the latest of many broken todo lists and behavior influencing attempts for myself. As usual, I would like to integrate all the old ones into this, if it works.
