I'm logging my attempts to de-/re- program my behaviors towards ones I prefer. I was inspired by starting to read a book on mind control.

This is the latest of many broken todo lists and behavior influencing attempts for myself. As usual, I would like to integrate all the old ones into this, if it works. 

# The Plan

## Phase 1: Does it work?

1. Select an approach such as chanting that can sometimes get a hard task to initiate quickly and continue.
2. The approach will be used carefully and slowly, and each use will be logged in this repository.
3. The frequency of use will be steadily increased, on a schedule that is specific to task categories.
   That is, if a category of tasks is harder, the approach will be used less frequently, at first.

The intent is to use the logging to sort categories and plan around what works and what doesn't.
The expectation is that, given my experience struggling and strengthening, this
approach can be made to succeed for general tasks.

## Phase 2: Be conscious and rational

Once it is demonstrated the approach can continue working consistently while being logged, I'll want to
focus on behaviors that engage important things like executive functioning, major goals, rational choices, etc.

An idea is to support these both by encouraging their larger goal, and by encouraging the parts needed to reach them.

# The environment

`git --config http.followRedirects=true [clone/remote ...]` to access the
arweave remote at the bottom of arkb.log, which is spread across multiple
uploads using git's alternates mechanism.

- README.md
	This file. Ideally a clear entrypoint.
- upload.bash
	A start to appropriate _log storage_. Associated with goals regarding git repositories.
- notes.txt
	A start to _deciding what to do_. Can hold just some notes for planning what behaviors to use.
- phase1
	Folder can contain logs of phase 1. Keep logs under 99KB for bundlr upload.
