first we'll need a goal of setting up how to do it
we'll want a goal to add after that: how about deciding based on reasons and properties
	that wants a pair, so how about setting a schedule to resume this, and then doing an existing goal

plan:
	- property-based deciding with very-slow and accelerate-gently (increase increasingness very gently)
		[note: stimulate stopping less for this]
		[there is a space where this improves. memories and multitasking are helpful attributes.]
	- maybe: one or more easier things to establish the reinforcing behavior
		ideas include: this repository, existing shower pattern, simple-schedule
		basically: _existing goals_, especially with return for other goals. this may have other benefits too.
norms:
	- keep files under 100KoB
	- log brainwaves when doing task

even though phase 1 is "for demo" we'll want to pick good behaviors with significant impact on our goals or life.
	for example, how the wim hof thing does all of shower (for hygiene and normal world) outdoors (for lifestyle prefrence) and practicing-doing-stuff (for de-/re- programming skills). it doesn't have to be that multipronged, but we want to go better than random, maybe at least two steps better than random.
	what task would be better than this? have i done that at least twice?

	sometimes we compare things based on "properties" which work when dissociated.
	we'll likely form a goal aroudn manipulating a property list, as a harder task needing a lot of slowness
		ok i'm feeling that out, let's start withj an easier task to establish as a fallback, and try to
		keep them separate
	ok i guess :(
		ok let's do them side by side
	we need [todo-list/executive-functioning/deciding-things-based-on-reasons] to grow steadily. not with reducing.
	ideally with _increasing_. how about start very slow, and steady increase? i think we'll agree to that.
good talk good talk.
